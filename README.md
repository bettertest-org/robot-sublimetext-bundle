under Sublime Text packages directory named "Robot Txt" --to see the Packages folder location from
SublimeText, go to menu (Preferences -> Browse Packages).
It is C:\Users\[your user name]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages on Windows 7,
or ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages in Mac OSX.

Additionally, set Robot syntax highlighting as default for txt files
(View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as -> Robot Txt)
